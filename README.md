# Scientific Python: cookie

[![Actions Status][actions-badge]][actions-link]
[![GitHub Discussion][github-discussions-badge]][github-discussions-link]

A cookiecutter template for new Python projects based on the Scientific Python
Developer Guide. What makes this different from other cookie cutter templates
for Python packages?

- Designed from the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][]: Every decision is
  clearly documented and every tool described.
- Template generation tested in GitHub Actions using nox.
- Twelve different backends to choose from for building packages.
- Includes several compiled backends using pybind11, with wheels produced for
  all platforms using cibuildwheel.
- Follows PyPA best practices.

Be sure you have read the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][] first, and
possibly used them on a project or two. This is _not_ a minimal example or
tutorial. It is a collection of useful tooling for starting a new project using
cookiecutter, or for copying in individual files for an existing project (by
hand, from `{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/`).

During generation you can select from the following backends for your package:

1. [hatch][]: This uses hatchling, a modern builder with nice file inclusion,
   extendable via plugins, and good error messages. **(Recommended for pure
   Python projects)**
2. [setuptools][]: The classic build system. Most powerful, but high learning
   curve and lots of configuration required.
3. [setuptools621][setuptools]: The classic build system, but with the new
   standardized configuration. Python 3.7+.
4. [pybind11][]: This is setuptools but with an C++ extension written in
   [pybind11][] and wheels generated by [cibuildwheel][].
5. [scikit-build][]: A scikit-build (CMake) project also using pybind11, using
   scikit-build-core. **(Recommended for C++ projects)**
6. [meson-python][]: A Meson project also using pybind11.
7. [poetry][]: An all-in-one solution to pure Python projects. Replaces
   setuptools, venv/pipenv, pip, wheel, and twine. Higher learning curve, but is
   all-in-one. Makes some bad default assumptions for libraries.
8. [flit][]: A modern, lightweight [PEP 621][] build system for pure Python
   projects. Replaces setuptools, no MANIFEST.in, setup.py, or setup.cfg. Low
   learning curve. Easy to bootstrap into new distributions. Difficult to get
   the right files included, little dynamic metadata support.
9. [pdm][]: A modern, less opinionated all-in-one solution to pure Python
   projects supporting standards. Replaces setuptools, venv/pipenv, pip, wheel,
   and twine. Supports [PEP 621][], and also the unaccepted [PEP 582][].
10. [trampolim][]: A modern [PEP 621][] builder with support for tasks, allowing
    arbitrary Python to run during the build process if needed.
11. [whey][]: A modern [PEP 621][] builder with some automation options for
    Trove classifiers. Development seems to be stalled, possibly.
12. [maturin][]: A [PEP 621][] builder for Rust binary extensions.
    **(Recommended for Rust projects)**

Currently, the best choice is probably hatch for pure Python projects, and
setuptools (such as the pybind11 choice) for binary projects.

#### To use:

Install cookiecutter, ideally with `brew install cookiecutter` if you use brew,
otherwise with `pipx install cookiecutter` (or prepend `pipx run` to the command
below, and skip installation). Then run:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:scikit-hep/cookie
```

You can also use `pipx run cookiecutter` without installing.

Check the key setup files, `pyproject.toml`, and possibly `setup.cfg` and
`setup.py` (pybind11 example). Update README.md. Also update and add docs to
`docs/`.

There are a few example dependencies and a minimum Python version of 3.7, feel
free to change it to whatever you actually need/want.

#### Contained components:

- GitHub Actions runs testing for the generation itself
  - Uses nox so cookie development can be checked locally
- GitHub actions deploy
  - C++ backends include cibuildwheel for wheel builds
  - Uses PyPI trusted publisher deployment
- Dependabot keeps actions up to date periodically, through useful pull requests
- Formatting handled by pre-commit
  - No reason not to be strict on a new project; remove what you don't want.
  - Includes MyPy - static typing
  - Includes Black - standardizing formatting
  - Includes strong Ruff-based linting and autofixes
    - Replaces Flake8, isort, pyupgrade, yesqa, pycln, and dozens of plugins
  - Includes spell checking
- An pylint nox target can be used to run pylint, which integrated GHA
  annotations
- A ReadTheDocs-ready Sphinx docs folder and `[docs]` extra
- A test folder and pytest `[test]` extra
- A noxfile is included with a few common targets

Setuptools only:

- Setuptools controlled by `setup.cfg` and a nominal `setup.py`.
  - Using declarative syntax avoids needless boilerplate that is often wrong
    (like incorrectly handling the encoding when opening a README).
  - Easier to adapt to PEP 621 eventually.
  - Any actual logic can sit in setup.py and be clearly separate from simple
    metadata.
- Versioning handled by `setuptools_scm`
  - You can easily switch to manual versioning, but this avoids duplicating the
    version as git tags and in the source, and versions _every_ commit uniquely,
    sidestepping some caching problems.
- `MANIFEST.in` checked with check-manifest
- `setup.cfg` checked by setup-cfg-fmt

#### For developers:

You can test locally with [nox][]:

```console
# See all commands
nox -l

# Run all tests and checks (takes several minutes)
nox

# Run a specific check
nox -s "lint(setuptools)"

# Run a noxfile command on the project noxfile
nox -s "nox(whey)" -- docs
```

If you don't have `nox` locally, you can use [pipx][], such as `pipx run nox`
instead.

#### Other similar projects

[Hypermodern-Python][hypermodern] is another project worth checking out with
many similarities, like great documentation for each feature and many of the
same tools used. It has a slightly different set of features, and has a stronger
focus on GitHub Actions - most our guide could be adapted to a different CI
system fairly easily if you don't want to use GHA. It also forces the use of
Poetry (instead of having a backend selection), and doesn't support compiled
projects. It currently dumps all development dependencies into a shared
environment, causing long solve times and high chance of conflicts. It also does
not use pre-commit properly. It also has quite a bit of custom code.
