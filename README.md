A cookiecutter template for new Python projects, designed off of the
[Scikit-HEP developer guidelines][]. Template generation tested in GitHub
Actions.

Be sure you have read the [Scikit-HEP developer guidelines][] first, and
possibly used them on a project or two. This is _not_ a minimal example
or tutorial. It is a collection of useful tooling for starting a new project
using cookiecutter, or for copying in individual files for an existing project
(by hand, from `{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/`).

This is a Python template project, with the following project types:

1. [setuptools][]: The classic build system. Most powerful, but high learning curve
   and lots of config required.
2. [pybind11][]: This is setuptools but with an C++ extension written in [pybind11][]
   and wheels generated by [cibuildwheel][].
3. [poetry][]: An all-in-one solution to pure Python projects. Replaces setuptools,
   venv/pipenv, pip, wheel, and twine. Higher learning curve, but is
   all-in-one.
4. [flit][]: A modern, lightweight build system for pure Python projects. Replaces
   setuptools, no MANIFEST.in, setup.py, or setup.cfg. Low learning curve.
5. [flit621][flit]: Flit, but with PEP 621 style configuration (hidden feature).
6. [trampolim][]: A modern PEP 621 builder with support for tasks, allowing
   arbitrary Python to run during the build process if needed. Python 3.7+ only
   (for building from source, wheels can be anything).
7. [whey][]: A modern PEP 621 builder with some automation options for Trove classifiers.

#### To use:

Install cookiecutter, ideally with `brew install cookiecutter` if you use brew,
otherwise with `pipx install cookiecutter`. Then run:


```bash
cookiecutter gh:scikit-hep/cookie
```

Answer all the questions. If you are not making a Scikit-HEP repo, just enter a
different org name. (You can also use `pipx run cookiecutter` without installing).

Check the key setup files, `pyproject.toml`, and possibly `setup.cfg` and
`setup.py` (pybind11 example). Update README.md. Also update and add docs to
`docs/`.

There are a few example dependencies and a minimum Python version of 3.6,
feel free to change it to whatever you actually need/want. Hopefully not Python
2.7.

#### Contained components:

* GitHub actions runs testing
    - Uses nox so development can be checked locally
* GitHub actions deploy
    - Be sure to add a token
* Dependabot keeps actions up to date periodically, through useful pull requests
* Formatting handled by pre-commit
    - No reason not to be strict on a new project; remove what you don't want.
    - Includes MyPy - static typing
    - Includes strong Flake8 checking
    - Includes auto fixes for most flake8 problems
    - Includes Black - standardizing formatting
    - Includes isort for nice import sorting/grouping
    - Includes PyUpgrade - keeps old Python syntax out
* A rough version of ReadTheDocs Sphinx docs provided

Setuptools only:

* Setuptools controlled by `setup.cfg` and a nominal `setup.py`.
    - Using declarative syntax avoids needless boilerplate that is often wrong
      (like incorrectly handling the encoding when opening a README).
    - Easier to adapt to PEP 621 eventually.
    - Any actual logic can sit in setup.py and be clearly separate from simple
      metadata.
* Versioning handled by `setuptools_scm`
    - You can easily switch to manual versioning, but this avoids duplicating
      the version as git tags and in the source, and versions _every_ commit
      uniquely, sidestepping some caching problems.


#### For developers:

You can test locally with [nox][]:

```console
# See all commands
nox -l

# Run all tests and checks (takes several minutes)
nox

# Run a specific check
nox -s "lint(setuptools)"
```

If you don't have `nox` locally, you can use [pipx][], such as `pipx run nox` instead.
