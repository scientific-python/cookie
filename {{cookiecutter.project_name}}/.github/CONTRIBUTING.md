# Quick development

The fastest way to start with development is to use nox. If you don't have nox,
you can use `pipx run nox` to run it without installing, or `pipx install nox`.
If you don't have pipx (pip for applications), then you can install with with
`pip install pipx` (the only case were installing an application with regular
pip is reasonable). If you use macOS, then pipx and nox are both in brew, use
`brew install pipx nox`.

To use, run `nox`. This will lint and test using every installed version of
Python on your system, skipping ones that are not installed. You can also run
specific jobs:

```console
$ nox -s lint  # Lint only
$ nox -s tests  # Python tests
$ nox -s docs -- serve  # Build and serve the docs
$ nox -s build  # Make an SDist and wheel
```

Nox handles everything for you, including setting up an temporary virtual
environment for each run.

# Setting up a development environment manually

You can set up a development environment by running:

{% if cookiecutter.project_type == "poetry" -%}

```bash
poetry install
```

{%- else -%}

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -v -e .[dev]
```

If you have the
[Python Launcher for Unix](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher), you
can instead do:

```bash
py -m venv .venv
py -m install -v -e .[dev]
```

{%- endif %}

# Post setup

You should prepare pre-commit, which will help you by checking that commits pass
required checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit # or brew install pre-commit on macOS
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or
`pre-commit run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

# Testing

Use pytest to run the unit checks:

```bash
pytest
```

# Coverage

Use pytest-cov to generate coverage reports:

```bash
pytest --cov={{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
```

# Building docs

You can build the docs using:

```bash
nox -s docs
```

You can see a preview with:

```bash
nox -s docs -- serve
```

# Pre-commit

This project uses pre-commit for all style checking. While you can run it with
nox, this is such an important tool that it deserves to be installed on its own.
Install pre-commit and run:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

to check all files.
