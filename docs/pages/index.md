# Python Library Development Guide

Do you have a pile of scientific Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that are
becoming unwieldy? Are changes to some parts of your code accidentally breaking
other parts of your code? Do you want to more maintainable, reusable, and
shareable form? This guide is for you.

This guide aims to help scientists who write code find good practices and
standard tools, and to help small- and medium-sized scientific software projects
start off on the right foot.

Keeping in mind that too much software infrastructure can be overwhelming to
those who haven't yet encountered the need for it, we introduce only the core
essentials in an opinionated tutorial
[tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/tutorials/index.md %}).

[Topical guides]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/guides/index.md %}) provide
task-based instruction on topics that scientists may encounter as their projects
evolve and grow.
