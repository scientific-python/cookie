# Scientific Python Library Development Guide

This guide is maintained by the scientific Python community for the benefit of
fellow scientists and research software engineers.

**Learn the essentials.** Do you have a pile of scientific Python scripts or
Jupyter notebooks that are becoming unwieldy? Are changes to some parts of your
code accidentally breaking other parts of your code? Do you want to more
maintainable, reusable, and shareable form? Start at the
[tutorial]({% link pages/tutorials/index.md %}).

**Learn recommended tools and best practices.** [Topical
guides]({% link pages/guides/index.md %}) provide task-based instruction on
topics that scientists and research software engineers may encounter as their
projects evolve and grow. This covers everything from writing and building
documentation to modern Python packaging.

**Learn to write better research code.** A high-level document on
[principles]({% link pages/principles/index.md %}) provides advice based on the
community's collective experience building code that is easier for researchers
to use successfully and easier to maintain over time.

**Use our solutions for common tasks.** A growing collection of
[patterns]({% link pages/patterns/index.md %}) provides tested approaches for
tasks and can be tricky to get exactly right, such as including data files with
Python packages.

This guide does _not_ cover the basics of Python itself or the scientific Python
libraries. We recommend the [SciPy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/).

This guide also does not cover version control, but it is essential to have a
basic facility with git to use these tools successfully. We recommend the
[Software Carpentry lesson on git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
