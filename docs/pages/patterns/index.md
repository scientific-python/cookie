# Patterns

Patterns is a collection of common patterns in scientific software that are
worth learning. These try to highlight best practices for specific situations,
and may cover common tools related to that pattern.

If you want to put data in a package and load it, see [Including data files][].

If you would like to use backport packages, see [Backports][].

If you are wondering about public API, see [Exports][].
