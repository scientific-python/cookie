# Topical Guides

The pages here are intended for developers who are making or maintaining a
package and want to follow modern best practices in Python.

New developers are encouraged to read the following pages. Veteran developers
should still check out the [tutorials][], as it has a guide on recommendations
for your `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and at least glance through other sections.

Following that, there are recommendations for [style][], intended to promote
good practices and to ensure continuity across the packages. There is a
[dedicated page for static type checking with MyPy][mypy]. There is then a guide
on [simple packaging][], [compiled packaging][], or even [classic packaging][],
which should help in ensuring a consistent developer and user experience when
working with distribution.

A section on CI follows, with a [general setup guide][gha_basic], and then two
choices for using CI to distribute your package, on for [pure Python][gha_pure],
and one for [compiled extensions][gha_wheels]. You can read about setting up
good tests on the [pytest page][pytest], with [coverage][]. There's also a page
on setting up [docs][], as well.

{: .highlight-title }

> New project template
>
> Once you have completed the guidelines, there is a
> [copier][]/[cookiecutter][]/[cruft][] project, [scientific-python/cookie][],
> that implements these guidelines and lets you setup a new package from a
> template in less than 60 seconds! Eleven build backends including compiled
> backends, generation tested in Nox, and kept in-sync with the guide.

{: .important-title }

> Checking an existing project
>
> We provide [sp-repo-review][], a set of [repo-review][] checks for comparing
> your repository with the guidelines, runnable [right in the guide][] via
> WebAssembly! All checks point to a linked badge in the guide.
